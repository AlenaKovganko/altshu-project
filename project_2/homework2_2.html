            <span>HTML5 stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to create content on the world wide web
                like
                webpages. HTML5 is the fifth revision of the language's standard. It was published in October 2014,
                17
                years after HTML4 was standardized.<br /><br />

                HTML5 aims to provide improved support for latest multimedia. It also reduced dependency on plugins
                and

                    document. If
                    you wishto include this in a sidebar, you will have to provide the appropriate markup and
                    styling
